## Notes

This port requires the 1.3 Steam release of the game. You can purchase it at https://store.steampowered.com/app/239070/Hammerwatch/.

The port is compatible with all supported OS' and devices, except for Rocknix in libmali mode (switch to Panfrost), and TrimUI devices on Knulli. Compatibility will increase, so stay tuned.

*Warning: This port takes 30-40 seconds to load on entry level devices. Switch your CPU governor to `performance` for the best experience.*

This port uses the new Westonpack runtime and libcrusty to provide X11 compatibility on devices that do not support X11. The runtime is still in active development and somewhat experimental. If you are experiencing issues, please reach out to me on the PM discord server, so i can improve this runtime. Thanks!
