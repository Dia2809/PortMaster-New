## Notes
---
#### Setting Database Scan Directory

Would ***highly*** suggest setting database scan directory before scanning/building the database. Have `Database` highlighted, press `START` button to pull up the database menu and scroll down and select the `Select directories to scan` option.

Press `A` to enter highlighted directories. Once you have you your main music folder highlighted, press `A` again until the folder icon turns into a "play" symbol. Press `B` to exit and press `A` to save changes, then `A` again to initialize database.

When it finishes, restart Rockbox.

#### Extending/Disabling Backlight Timeout

By default, Rockbox has a 15 second display timeout. If you would like to extend (or disable) this feature... go to `Settings > General Settings > Display > LCD Settings > Backlight`.

#### Enable Lock-key Exemptions

If you would like to use media keys to control Rockbox while locked (bluetooth/usb), go to `Settings > General Settings > System > Advanced Key Lock`. Set `Enabled` to `Yes` and then under `Settings` toggle `Exempt Play`, `Exempt Seek` and `Exempt Skip` on.

#### Installing Themes:

`Note: Themes created pre-4.0 may not display correctly even if listed as working with 4.0/dev build.`

Download any themes from the `Ipod Classic` section [here](https://themes.rockbox.org/index.php?target=ipod6g) and extract. Copy the contents inside the `.rockbox` folder into the `rockbox` directory. 

Make sure to restart Rockbox to fix theme paths before applying a theme.
