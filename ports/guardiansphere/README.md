## Notes

Thanks to [Pixel Archipel](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/) for creating this excellent game, and for granting PortMaster permission to distribute the game files.

This package includes a widescreen patch. To apply it:

1. Delete `patch.xdelta3`
2. Delete the folder `Guardian Sphere Linux - patched` (if it exists)
3. Rename `patch169.xdelta3` to `patch.xdelta3`
4. Run the game to apply the new patch

**ROCKNIX Users:** You must use the Panfrost graphics driver (not libMali).

Gameplay becomes increasingly chaotic as the game progresses. More powerful handhelds will deliver smoother performance during the later stages.
