Hello from the PortMaster community where we bring PC ports to arm-based linux devices. I have gotten Inferna working and am wondering if the devs like @jack would allow PortMaster to distribute the game or would you prefer users to download it from itch.io directly?
Thank you for making such wonderful games

yea i'm cool with that, maybe just put a link to the original itch.io page somewhere if you can :)
