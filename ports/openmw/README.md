## Resolution Scaling

This port makes use of resolution scaling to achieve very stable FPS on all devices, from the R36S up through higher end handhelds. Resolution Scaling can be adjusted via `openmw/openmw/settings.cfg`. By default, Resolution Scaling is set to `0.5`. This can be any number between `0.1` to `1.0` based on preference and device capability.

This can significantly impact performance, and a lower resolution scale can allow for significantly improved playability on low end devices. 

## Mods

OpenMW supports a wide variety of mods. Depending on your hardware you'll have varing levels of success in installing the more demanding mods. Some mods however can greatly improve performance and/or gameplay.

The PortMaster port will automatically handle the following mods, extracting them and installing them if they are placed into `ports/openmw/mods/` fully zipped. By default we list the versions we have tested with, other versions may work.

It is highly recommended you install all the mods at once and not adding them piecemeal. If an unsupported mod is detected it will be placed into `ports/openmw/mods_unused/`.

### Manual Mod Installation

Other mods, as well as alternate versions of listed mods can be installed manually. Please follow the readme for the specific mods you're installing for general install directions. Due to the wide variety of mods for Morrowind, we cannot give detailed instructions to cover them all. That being said, the openmw/data directory performs the same as the Data Files directory in a standard PC installation of Morrowind, so you can install any manual mod normally with this in mind. 

Once your mod is installed, you will need to direct the port to load it. This is done by editing `ports/openmw/openmw/openmw.cfg`. Scroll to the bottom of the cfg file and add `content=modname.esp`. Specify the mod's name and plugin type (`.esp`, `.esm`, `.omwscripts` or `.omwaddon`), as well as choose it's placement in the load order. Ensure all plugins load AFTER the `Morrowind.esm`, `Tribunal.esm`, and `Bloodmoon.esm` files by placing the plugins on lower lines. 


Example config:

```ini
content=Morrowind.esm
content=Tribunal.esm
content=Bloodmoon.esm
content=Patch for Purists.esm
content=Patch for Purists - Book Typos.ESP
content=Patch for Purists - Semi-Purist Fixes.ESP
content=Better Heads.esm
content=Better Heads Tribunal addon.esm
content=Better Heads Bloodmoon addon.esm
content=Better Heads.esp
content=Better Heads Tribunal addon.esp
content=Better Heads Bloodmoon addon.esp
