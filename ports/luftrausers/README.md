### Rocknix libmali

This port is not compatible with Rocknix libmali. Please use the system menus to switch to Panfrost.

### Performance

This game is not recommended on anything weaker than an h700 (r36s etc.), might also experience some lag on trimui devices. 

### Aspect ratio

The game runs at a fixed 3:2 ratio, if you wish to make it stretch to fill the screen, open `ports/luftrausers/gamedata/data/gfx/pipelines/cubepipeline.json` and change the second to last line to `    "writeout" : "combo"`.
