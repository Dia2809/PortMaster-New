## Notes

Thanks to [NZ:P Team](https://docs.nzp.gay/) for the game.

Also thanks to the PortMaster team for all of the work they do.

## Detailed Instructions

The installer automatically takes care of setting up the game.

## Controls

The default controller mapping is pretty good, and you can change everything in the in-game settings (Configuration --> Controls --> Bindings).

Few notes:
- by default, the aim down sight is L2 and the fire is R2, which works well with devices with stacked shoulder and trigger buttons, but very awkward with in-line buttons. The installer changes the mapping to L1 and R1 respectively, in order to give a good out-of-the-box experience for everybody, but it is highly recommended to switch back to L2 and R2 if you have stacked buttons.
- some of the settings (e.g. sensitivity) has a slider, however, it only accepts mouse clicks. The dpad does not work with them. Press 'start' + 'a' to get a mouse pointer, and use the left analog stick and the 'a' button to change the value on the sliders. Press 'start' again when you're done, to exit from the mouse control mode.
- if you need to enter text (e.g. to change the name of the soldier, enter IP address for multi-player, etc), press 'select' + 'b' to enter text input mode. In that mode, the face buttons can be used to add/remove letters.

## Controls on devices without analog sticks

The installer automatically configures the bindings on first run, to ensure that the game is playable even if you don't have analog sticks, with the following bindings:

| Button | Description |
| - | - |
| dpad | move forward, backward, and strafe |
| a | turn right |
| b | look down |
| x | look up |
| y | turn left |
| select | action (rebuild barricade, purchase weapons, open doors, etc) |
| l1 | aim down sight |
| l2 | reload weapon |
| r1 | fire |
| r2 | sprint |

With these bindings, some actions, such as jumping, changing stance, using melee or grenades, are not available by default. You also won't be able to swap weapons, you'll have to keep using the one you purchased last.

You can change the bindings in the in-game settings, however, avoid re-mapping the dpad and abxy buttons, since those are used for movement and looking around.
